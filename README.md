# Welcome
This temporarily untitled project is aimed to help memorizing vocabularies.
# System Requirements
No complex environment configuration is needed. Only python3 installation in a linux distro is required to run the program.
# Using the program
The program itself does not bring any vocabulary data. This should be provided with a dictionary in json format.
Open the linux terminal, switch to your working dir.
  $python main.py
It should work fine.
This is a python3 program only tested on FEDORA-22 and has some known conflicts with windows.
